This file talks on how to deal with branches in GIT

A branch is nothing but a copy of the code of parent branch.
Lets say two devs are working on a proj, and they have a lead dev who is working on main branch which
is used by many customers.

Now for the other devs to work they can't work directly on main, so git allows them to create branches of
their own work on a feature on those branches and then to merge them they can either raise a PR( pull req)
or merge via git CLI, if they have access.

Branches are used for above purpose.

Commands on branches :

git branch --> gives the current working branch

git branch -M <enter the name>--> to rename a branch

git checkout <branch name> --> to move from one branch to another

git checkout -b <new branchname> --> to create a branch

git branch -d <branch name> --> to del a branch
