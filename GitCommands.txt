Initialising Git repo from our local machine.

Git init -- Init command is used to initialise our local folder as a git repo.

After running this command, an empty git repo would be initialised.
Now create a git repo in our GitHub account and copy that link and paste it in below cmd
to link our local repo to remote repo.

git remote add origin <link here>

git remote -v  --> to check the remote repo

git branch --> to get branch name
